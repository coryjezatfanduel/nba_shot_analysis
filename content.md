## Identiying over- and under-valued NBA players using Machine Learning

# Goals of this Analysis
As I'm putting this together on the eve of the NBA 2017 season tipoff, my goal is to use Machine Learning to create a metric to better understand the offensive efficiency of NBA players - specifically related to their shot selection. Traditional metrics that we read in the box score are often result-based, counting metrics. While these metrics are easy to track, they often do a poor job of crediting the "inputs" of a given "outcome" during a play. For example, if a defender forces a bad shot, they don't get credit for a block, but they created a much lower probability of success for the offense. Similarly, if a shooter takes quality shots - i.e. those with a high expected value - but does not make the shot, traditional metrics might discourage the player from shooting that high quality shot again. 

Our model attempts to create a metric for each player in 2016 - EVDelta (Expected Value vs. Actual Value). If successful, this metric will take into account all quantifiable aspects of a shot taken in the NBA, and allow us to understand players who overperformed their expectations (got lucky) or underperformed their expectations (were unlucky).
